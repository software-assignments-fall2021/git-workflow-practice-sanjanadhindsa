# The Importance of CS Education in K-12 Schools

_For my article, I chose this one:
https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-do-we-know-about-the-expansion-of-k-12-computer-science-education/_

This article talks about the importance of engaging and exposing young kids to computer science education and the difficulties 
which come from accessing this education. There are numerous factors which seem to inhibit widespread implementation of CS curriculums throughout the world, despite the growing demand for many CS degrees and jobs. 
Firstly, there is a big shortage of properly qualified CS teachers. There are many misconceptions about computer science, and given that it is a rapidly evolving field, many teachers aren't properly equipped with the subject matter needed to teach it.
Additionally, it can be difficult to engage students with learning computer science, especially girls. Girls have usually been underrepresented in STEM fields and it can be difficult to engage girls with CS content because they are less exposed to STEM at a young age -- often due to cultural perceptions and representations/stereotypes of women. 
I find this article particularly interesting because I'm currently a Computer Science Teaching Assistant at a high school in Manhattan through Microsoft TEALS.
One thing I've noticed throughout my TA experience is: first, not only are there a disproportionate amount of males to females in the classroom, but many students
aren't interested in CS in the first place. Most students in the classes I've TA'ed for didn't have a choice in being placed into the elective, and instead felt forced to be there and thus weren't as interested in the subject matter. 
This article, however, discusses a lot of the ways we can get students more engaged with CS content because another interesting thing I noticed last year -- which was my first year as part of the 
TEALS program, was that students slowly developed an interest in CS content as the year progressed. This interest which develops shows me that it's not necessarily computer science as a subject which 
turns many students off of learning it, but instead preconceived notions of the topics (i.e. it's "too difficult" or "not applicable") and lack of exposure which limits
students.

This is a very important for article, for both software developers and students. With technology advancing at an incredible rate, it is vital for education programs around the world to implement more computer science into the curriculum. This addition would certainly have helped me when I was in high school, as CS has taught me to solve problems and think algorithmically in areas other than programming.
